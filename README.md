# latex-tutorial

A brief $\LaTeX$ tutorial made for the University of Manitoba Space Applications and Technology Society ([UMSATS](http://www.umsats.ca/)).

The tutorial consists of a 30 minute lecture and a fill-in-the-blank handout for students to complete.

The lecture covers the fundamentals needed to start using LaTeX, such as
* What LaTeX is.
* What [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is.
* How a basic LaTeX document is organized (preamble, title, content).
* What the different preamble commands do (`\documentclass`, `\usepackage`, title and table of content commands).
* How to write text and lists.
* How to write math.
* How to add figures and tables.
* How to link different parts of the document with `\label` and the hyperref package. 

In the handout, the students are given a chance to try these basic commands and ask questions as they go.
